# This script install dependencies for equal / simbiose app developpement and building.

# This script has been written for linux but can be adapted for Windows or MacOS easily.

# You will need a recent version of nodejs to compile the project and its dependencies.
# You can install nodejs 18.17 (LTS version at the time this script was written) 
#Â with these commands

mkdir dep-files
cd dep-files

# Cloning dependencies from github
git clone https://github.com/yesbabylon/symbiose-ui.git
cd symbiose-ui
git checkout dev-2.0
git pull

sh build.sh
sh export.sh

# You should good to go ! you can compile apps with the build.sh file in the app directory
